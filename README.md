# sort_photos

Python script to sort .JPG photos and puts the photos in a day to day folder.

MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR PHOTOS FIRST!

To run first make sure you have Python(2) installed. If not you can download it here.

Run the script from the command line and be sure you're in the right directory:
C:\users\joey\sort_photos> python sort_photos.py <dir>
  
So in my example I would use:
C:\users\joey\sort_photos> python sort_photos.py E:\Users\Joey\Desktop\USA2017
